of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nTRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH\n\nGet instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\n\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT\n\nIf you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\n\nFit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\n\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Fit and your integrated apps in the redesigned journal. Or, get the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nKEEP A FINGER ON THE PULSE OF YOUR HEALTH\n\nBreathing is one of the simplest ways to reduce tension and relieve stress. With Fit, checking in with your breath is easy\u2014all you need is your phone camera. As well as your respiratory rate, you can measure your heart rate to get a better understanding of your body\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: www.google.com\/fit","downloads":"100,000,000+","downloads_max":500000000,"downloads_min":100000000,"email":"apps-help@google.com","from_developer":["com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user","com.google.android.apps.translate"],"i18n_lang":["el","en","vi","ca","fr-ca","it","pt-br","cs","et","id","es","ru","nl","pt","no","zh-tw","tr","lv","zh-cn","lt","th","ro","pl","fr","bg","uk","hr","de","hu","fi","da","ja","ko","sv","sk","ms","en-gb","pt-pt","sl","ar"],"iap":false,"interactive_elements":[],"lang":"en","market_source":"GOOGLE","market_update":"2022-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","package_name":"com.google.android.apps.fitness","permissions":[{"id":"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.INTERNET","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.READ_SYNC_SETTINGS","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.READ_SYNC_STATS","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.GET_PACKAGE_SIZE","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.VIBRATE","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.CAMERA","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES","source":"uses_permission"},{"id":"android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION","source":"uses_permission_sdk_23"}],"physical_address":"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View 94043","price":"","price_i18n_countries":[],"price_numeric":0,"rating":3.9759390354156494,"ratings_1":76250,"ratings_2":24278,"ratings_3":38339,"ratings_4":65753,"ratings_5":303422,"screenshots":["https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/fAvgVK17vHg9u2vunheRDa-oARLz338U2-vgdBtrpESk9KHwuIzfI18C8J90SaZsI_c=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/XbLMBC4ZgXRa5qB2FyKxAufNtQ0p00dqW5zw8LsA4DoiF6ikMLmnOgs099BpCcrRXM4=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/krIjCL2Ew2ldj9zkVCTN4d-IMpo5_kSf7_PfPPWJgydESNrmgfLW5UAqhcK1YW9PxA=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/bKZ7OcnxwEKtgMsb2qQGg4DpTD0_wY9UmLNG14l-1TyxkmxlajOhUdgyBc6aiQqOCA=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/POtMBU5sJXgNRDcSPS3AE5_7rUSesOw-vlYKrEf4Bq-oQRukpvr4luKGxdhjuooxb0Y=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/s_kuEZroENw_JfVVAK_InQyoc6bUi2boPRcmO83MyC6Gpvz_mZUrMDwOXl1jHweBkC4=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/QUu5nxk9UAq8qcySoY0qbp2fQKHjJl7SmvHymjzqrWygublIl08p6eAC5JH6RXEE64Ji=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/T7EH8ieyvRJdKcmxIH5UMm6dbaWGBfJ7hWEFeYGW_q1FNs9yEhTg3vbVImSoH2g7zA=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/lWCOqVE5h_WCPN8sA2kOVhajmy-VbyjXbWgGdhyU95lruKpwpMx-sG8HgCFlOKXZ0F_P=w720-h310"],"short_desc":"Want to take charge of your health?

Wherever you are at the airport, on the train, or on the bus, boost your concentration and make your brain shine with the brain-teasers reminiscent of Infinity Loop.\n\n\nBetter than a yoga session, Energy will relax your soul!\nPlay the king of logic games now!\n\n\nIf your body battery is fading, Energy is the perfect boost to recharge it! Featuring a minimalist style, a transmission circuit, and smart brain-teasers, this bright game will help you to calm your anxiety and get your concentration in line!\n\n\nEnergy is reminiscent of the classic Loop by its simplicity and satisfaction provided. You just need to tap the wire to rotate it and manage to connect all the lines. Make sure the transmission includes at least a lamp circle, a wire, and a lightning bolt circle to illuminate the light circuit. The wire loops will shine when everything is connected! \n\nPart of the famous Infinity Loop franchise, this calm, minimalist, and smart game will help you dealing with anxiety and OCD. Instead of closing endless loops, you must tap to connect every wire to the lamp and create a closed light transmission. Once you tap the first line, you will boost your concentration and reduce any symptoms of anxiety or OCD. Try to illuminate the circuit as many times as you can and recharge your soul with positive ideas. \n\n\nIn calm brain-teasers like this, you don\u2019t need to be super smart or fast as a lightning bolt to succeed. Creating a functional light circle using every wire, bolt, and lamp is more important than delivering a bright performance. ENERGY environment is satisfying and minimalist, featuring a calm soundtrack and endless light loops. The positive energy provided by this game will recharge your smartphone battery or make your brain shine like a star.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a minimalist tap game to boost your concentration, ENERGY is the right choice. Like other easy-to-learn logic games, this smart game features endless brain-teasers and its structure works as a circle: since you can\u2019t finish it, your progress is like an endless circle. Perfect to play while you are in a waiting line or at the airport.\n\n\nWorking as a concentration boost and a great way of fighting anxiety and OCD issues, Energy is also a fun way of improving creativity while you relax your soul. By connecting every wire, lamp, and bolt, you will illuminate the transmission and create bright light shapes. You become an archaeologist: once you complete the circuit, the loops will shine and you discover the hidden figure.\n\n\nWe associate ENERGY with yoga because this game is an excellent way to purify your mind and soul When you complete a dozen levels, your heart rate slows down. Just like in a yoga exercise.\n\nNote: This game is also available on Android Wear and Android Watches. And it's very fun as well!","rating":4.729284286499023,"ratings_1":9133,"ratings_2":4764,"ratings_3":20592,"ratings_4":96411,"ratings_5":565154,"category":"Puzzle","cat_int":27,"cat_type":1,"cat_key":"GAME_PUZZLE","cat_keys":["GAME_PUZZLE","GAME"],"price":"","price_numeric":0,"iap":true,"iap_min":2.99,"iap_max":22.99,"downloads":"10,000,000+","downloads_min":10000000,"downloads_max":50000000,"physical_address":"Rua Alves Redol, 3B 2675-285, Odivelas Portugal","interactive_elements":["Digital Purchases"],"version":"5.6.5","email":"support+energy@infinitygames.io","content_rating":"Everyone","what_is_new":"-Bug Fixes","market_update":"2022-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","screenshots":["https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/U_l-BqXvT6Z8fI8aUxSbvKonogaQRAVWOYkVaRsq8ZhhgmmsxGbkNNsyx_EMdnhCyBM=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/-aZhWVDvF--19huGKCe7TAqQ6A8Y0ZduZmLZwFHzqLiH0shh9MTc4Byas8LqX9wZtzM=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/ChRCSeDvWcOV5PhPOTJmhkmyZjgLg31xYsroZ9VMdLxDcUqnCR2k3v9ftzwreToTIw=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/d20I5cHiV5BC0RL0y4upudP3pCDnpXnaJDQ5D5bFEmGcr1cgh9KApswFVCS2_2BOgD0=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/4JM0vBJidtfzOD0pNH98oOIvXoTCRf9L-6Btzuh5IlcG_waNEXJULwZdN3SjIxdGJ0kN=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/pwF4bxc4yq5sTYwT_hfgEJSNCZxrCLTJJdLSnRWmNrqPjtOCnGGlsOp_sKLt_3wQUA=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/30p40fq5vqAuULAslxAKxl4_4hrhyjLkF_55csY9oqh6Z-0RnGqX_TzmEV1aqX7LUfE=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/3QsW0ennAzgMRv0tqnCZzguAwWjPcNSc6zpRUtRHOVpLNKtTO-dYNTZqRWlw2QGwJJk=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/esRS26swMtakiRjB-OCMoYr633Zj2KPfk3wreoxOkm-Z2KRR2orHXYArNo6Ix36E_zo=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/z3BRIrLYwdxKQAmoqE8x7rjC9ctlM2arO9y6cIJX-9ArOZa3gETduglVqUIMWupYMw=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/Wfs_diKBT4g3T2Qpr9i5czNDvD80stLXTdwejYrivlgpeaE6dkdViGWRsgQWlFWwUQic=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/gieHUcoFT73XD0G6x6DpcVG-Zyj-8EUQjWV5ph13awKypSW11kXwCaK_llC3-Y8rBg=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/1Ry1efHzKrOAoKBBo7CYVhUlQQbVWg7j5cmaSMze4TBjwFWNAYQW2eugXeEvdeB6xDc=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/IrFpJKtc8tsxFsWkw98N8vkn3UU_yZbnqaIXPpizlF0IBUat4n0_mJQe-yTFyy2qSiQ=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/Oiu2inqTvyg84oh_EqeprSJt4wt4ytVxY7VA0QfU3d-SiWKoX4TGWsYMhSReWHqbfGOR=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/F7nPFyh6tl84JQpvw-Zd2CgR9GjH59o5kY2cXAkGBwidgybhF0t0WVzSGqN0bFwRVg=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/RSQ90bN3JqDhkoOx8zjAucg7Li6nhs_zxEJFR9aGEvw-Dyw399Zk9Uo3jtI3NVr3kptQ=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/oqdsrH-QHm2xZGMbAtMkNVR8snaMSIdmg6Rl-p5dH0lw4zLwTk7GM2OFOLSVLzuwYZw=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/huS5imeg8mp7YlQCpOM5Wy1puuKaThHFc_WSHCauNxJvlUHrGbVikoe_iN0fuHgRFAY=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/VGaG0liYZ9nsOaWNIvedpAK4WPskBzNagxk0_-jGcYGzmry6eRGE5P6QCpnFOCbW5yI=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/-23g1gBG2uRnN7sCGHCVTiOi3LYrkixFdzqXnoaS-gHAzm_oi50VmOCI9zwuRhHWbTU=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/1YD7kSYyqnq2gty0xNAkSiHl7XdOAW692xhAvR-Uu1emN76pGgkvHoV3sbeSchs4jg=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/SLmoJgEZiZxC5cUusP5ImIys-HusZDpmeG1MgFehDPWlqU3n_ZHa4wUrq-K63FAOXw=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/Rf7S4cpfiHTgtMBxq6310PvLy87myUjI46nnc_FX3HTZP8izqeHYT3M4XlWqyhs3PMc=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/X2n1QucINeo_qNLTMpcD-7S2K29dZVYDQXiZ4Hj42znj1Utdn3pV5I-2snb-hclUxtk=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/0tnUDi1sQ2OJ_IPnBsDmrDCfY5AKOcOKNf2aUPNDdfLamiQcqrNijMU-JLrS8hiLdV7l=w720-h310"],"similar":["com.balysv.loop","com.rikudogames.maze","com.weplaydots.twodotsandroid","com.altshift.notnot","com.martinmagni.mekorama"],"from_developer":["com.rikudogames.maze","com.infinitygames.harmony"],"lang":"en","website":"https:\/\/www.infinitygames.io","short_desc":"Are you a puzzle master.

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of over 20,000 ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we\u2019re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don\u2019t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage in North America is also supplemented by real-time radar data. Coverage is variable and subject to change at any time.\n\nConnect with Flightradar24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24.
