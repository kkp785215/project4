The app can function offline without needing Internet or GPS. It is also packed with useful features such as destination alarms and a speedometer. Thank you to all the users who make the app better every day by sharing their feedback with us.\n\nSpotting Train Accurately \n\nGet live train status of Indian Railways anytime, anywhere. When you are traveling on a train, this feature can work without internet or GPS as it uses cell tower information to find the location. You can share current train location with your friends & family via the share feature. You can also set an alarm to wake you up at a fixed time before your railway station arrives. \n\nOffline Train Schedules\n\nThe train app has the Indian Railways timetable offline. You don't have to know train number or names as our Smart search feature allows you to use train source & destination or partial train names even with spelling errors.\n\nCoach Layout and Platform numbers\n\nGet information on coach position and seat\/berth layout before you board the train. Also shows platform numbers for boarding and intermediate stations wherever available.\n\nSuper efficient in Battery, Data Usage and App size\n\nThe app is very efficient in battery and data use as key features like finding train locations and schedules can work offline without Internet or GPS. The app-size is relatively small despite having a lot of information offline.\n\n\nSeat Availability and PNR Status \n\nCheck seat availability and PNR status on the official Indian Railways website within the app. \n\nDisclaimer: The app is privately maintained and does not have any affiliation whatsoever to Indian Railways.","downloads":"100,000,000+","downloads_max":500000000,"downloads_min":100000000,"email":"feedback@whereismytrain.in","from_developer":[],"i18n_lang":["en","en-gb"],"iap":false,"lang":"en","market_source":"GOOGLE","market_update":"2022-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","min_sdk":"5.0 and up","package_name":"com.whereismytrain.android","price":"","price_i18n_countries":[],"price_numeric":0,"promo_video":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Hi55FB12C9c?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0&autoplay=1","rating":4.345930099487305,"ratings_1":250122,"ratings_2":65390,"ratings_3":153853,"ratings_4":443319,"ratings_5":2065114,"screenshots":["https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/HRwhUIxYI0_fy1SOMtep_qr-ln5oVidliDMXT2itAcyRBhd5UC259_RYjUrrCd_XXA8=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/3OPyG5KZhzf57w1y_AAFBez2Z26cMjCH-t6NQ5L41pLCtOFv6xOfVlpFhboj0Nk0tTU=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/J1JQqqt6EPLN4UqlEB2dEJsEumZDcmc0YUAxXg6oKUyWzGlfGQVMHGBTbz_Eba0_4n58=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/ws5pzaab23FBEHPfKoHmTwCuXsNLF40nN8amJ7A0cJi8QZT6_kuW9ZXhqEK1BLq9rw=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/dUfEjA1_P1kPEQUsB6fTDY01nmW-rC9sV05yOqUNvOB_3_XwSg-HxGax57q0jVGBF0Y=w720-h310","https:\/\/play-lh.googleusercontent.com\/eCzVGver01bcOj-fw4CDu6EY8ttHnwLHRcmgC-puWmn6onCvj3FMr2jbnd1GFLQj-5o=w720-h310"],"similar":["in.trainman.trainmanandroidapp","com.entertaininglogixapps.gps.navigation.currency.converter.weather.map","com.truecaller","com.eyecon.global","com.what3words.android"],"size":12582912,"title":"Where is my Train","version":"6.9.8","website":"https:\/\/whereismytrain.in\/","what_is_new":"* Realme XT crash fix\n* Google Station Wi-Fi availability indicator\n\nPrevious Release:\n* Notification click crash fix\n* Repeated live status notification refresh bug fix in certain devices\n* Automatic PNR extraction from SMS feature is removed as per the new Play Store policy.
